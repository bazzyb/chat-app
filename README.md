# python-chat-app

A simple terminal based chat app. 
This is not a production project, it was simply used as a means to learn about sockets and encryption.

I built this project initially to get a better understanding of how sockets worked, but it also ended up being a good introduction to message encryption. 
It helped me understand the concept and purpose of asymmetric and symmetric keys, and how to handle securely passing a key, and sending encrypted messages. 

TO USE:
Server - simply run python3 server.py. This will allow local connections to port 8004 currently
Client - run python3 client.py, enter a username, and start chatting.
