Todo:
  ☐ Have user enter login, and maybe password, at start of client.py
  ☐ Server will request username, and maybe password, at connection
  ☐ It will go, conn -> S: Req Username -> C: Send Username -> S: Req Password -> C: Send Password
  ☐ This happens instantly, as credentials entered by client before connection
  ☐ Password is for if admin, or maybe all users
  ☐ If password wrong, reject, and client closes
  ☐ Maybe implement attempts, with ip or username
  ☐ have type enums on both sides:
      - username
      - password
      - message
      - kick
      - ban
      - login || "success", "fail", "restricted"
  ☐ Store history in local database, server has database, client has local database
  ☐ Persistent users
  ☐ Make into a Flask/Django app
