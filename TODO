Todo:
  ☐ Send encrypted messages to each user
  ☐ Close server gracefully
  ☐ I know how to encrpyt and decrypt messages, but need to know secure way of recording keys
  ☐ If not recording keys, how do I store message history, plain text, or some other encryption?
  ☐ This happens instantly, as credentials entered by client before connection
  ☐ Password is for if admin, or maybe all users
  ☐ If password wrong, reject, and client closes
  ☐ Maybe implement attempts, with ip or username
  ☐ Store history in local database, server has database, client has local database
  ☐ Persistent users
  ☐ Make into a Flask/Django app
